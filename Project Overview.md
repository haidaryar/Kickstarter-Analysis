**#Kickstarting with Excel**

**##Overview of Project**

Performed data data analysis for Kickstarter campaigns to determine success of a future campaign. Data for successful, failed, and canceled campaigns started between May 2009 and March 2017 were made available for the purpose of this project.

**###Purpose**

Analyses were done to help a theater artist decide the on, start date, setting campaign goal, and come to an understanding on whether her campaign would be successful or not.

**#Analysis and Challenges**

**##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

Data indicates that campaigns starting between months of May and July in any year have been successful in meeting their goals. Campaigns that started during the last quarter of a calendar year plus the month of January have been least successful. This could be indicative of the fact that people don't want to spend money on fundraising campaigns during the holiday season. Possibly because of their busy schedules or being tight on money.

**##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

Most campaigns that set their goal under $5000.00 have had better success compared to those with a higher goal. As indicated in the chart, the higher the campaign goal has been set the higher the failure rate is. There are a few outliers that need further analysis. Upon examining the data, I came to realization that keeping a theater running, foreign currency, and fundraising for a series of workshops contributed to those outliers.

**##Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

Some of the campaigns were miscategorized. For instance: Raising funds for a series of workshops had 'Plays' as its subcategory. Similarly, campaigns for supporting young artists or keeping a theater running were all miscategorized. These resulted in the visuals for outcomes based on goals to be skewed. Having multiple currencies in the data set also presented a challenge.

**##Results**

\#####Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

Data indicates that campaigns that started during the holiday season (November, December, and January) had a higher failure rate compared to other months. Holiday expenses and busier-than-regular schedules for campaign contributors are possibly the two main factors.

Based on the data, campaigns that started between months of May and June have been successful.

\###Outcome Based On Goals

Campaigns with their goal set below $5000.00 have been more successful compared to those with higher goal.

Some limitations to the dataset are as follows: We are missing 4 months' data for the year 2009 and 9 months' data for 2017. Additionally, different currencies have not been converted to USD.

Having an addition graph chart showing campaign length for successful vs failed campaign would be useful the end user. It will help her determine how long she should run her Kickstarter campaign for.

##Below are the two graphs created for this project.
